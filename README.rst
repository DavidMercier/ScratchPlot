ScratchPlot
=========
This Matlab toolbox has been developed to plot and to analyze scratch resistance and mechanical deformation of material from (nano)scratch results .

To get started with the ScratchPlot toolbox, clone the repository, then run Matlab, and cd into the folder containing this README file.

You can start the launcher by typing "demo" at the Matlab command prompt.

Features
--------

The ScratchPlot toolbox has been developed to plot and to analyze (nano)scratch dataset.

With this Matlab toolbox, it is possible:
    * to map (in 2D or 3D), to interpolate and to smooth indentation grid;
    * to plot elastic modulus vs hardness values;
    * to plot and to fit probability density functions;
    * to plot and to fit cumulative density functions;
    * to extract statistical values (mean, min, max with standard deviations) of mechanical properties and fractions for each phase;
    * to correct mechanical map from image correlation with microstructural map.

Matlab version
------------------
Developed with Matlab R2014a.
